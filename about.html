                                I spend my free time and derive energy from creating new things.   I put everything I have into every project I pursue and always push myself to try new things to add to my experience and strengthen my skills.  I enjoy the energy and inspiration of collaborating with others.

                                Though I am more artistically inclined, I have a good amount of experience with computer science. I learned to code at a very young age, and ever since, it has been a hobby of mine. My technological ability benefits my craft, because it expanded my horizons beyond just art. With my coding skills, I have made several video games, and even published one, titled BirdGut, to Steam. In video games, I find I can best combine my passion for animation, art, and coding into one beautiful thing.

                                My many projects over the years, grand and small, personal and otherwise, have taught me a great deal. Classical art has taught me the value of practice, animation taught me patience, and coding taught me perseverance. Every new challenge I take on teaches me more and helps me grow as a person.

                                I have always been passionate about telling stories whether through art, animation, or video games.  My goal is to work with a team to tell stories that change people's perspective of the world and perhaps even inspire people to actions that make the world a better place.

                            I like hiking, biking, drawing, painting, writing, coding, playing the piano, and 
                            animating. Most of my hobbies stimulate my creativity in one way or another, and often 
                            times take a lot of attention to detail.

                            There is no such thing as a problem that cannot be solved. If you look in the right place, 
                            you can always find a solution, and sometimes that means looking outside the box.
