                                In the engineering academy at my high school, there is a project at the end of each year where the students must come up with an invention, and devise a way to sell it. As with any invention, the idea comes as a solution to a problem, and the problem I chose to tackle was sitting. As it turns out, simply sitting greatly increases your risk of contracting potentially life-threatening diseases, like heart disease and diabetes. I decided to build a thin sheet that you place on any given seat, that connects wirelessly to your phone to warn you when you've been sitting for too long.
                            </p>

                                The seat senses pressure by running elecricity through a material called Velostat, and measuring the resistance through it. The measurement is fed to an arduino, which crunches the numbers to determine whether someone is sitting on the sheet. It sends a boolean value (a true or a false) to a bluetooth module, which then connects to the app on the phone. The app has a timer that continues ticking as long as it is reading true values from the arduino, and if the timer reaches the unhealthy or pre-set amount of time, it will send the user a notification demanding they stand. The notification was purposely made obnoxious enough to get the user to stand just to stop it. I sewed a case to go over the device so it isn't such an eyesore, see below, to the left.

                                The project won the first place award for showcase in the engineering academy in 2018.
