                                        BirdGut is a hand-drawn 2d puzzle-platformer from the perspective of an outcast bee who gets eaten by a bird, and discovers that the bird's internal organs are not organs at all, but facilities in which the consumed insects are brainwashed and enslaved. I made the whole thing myself in Unity Engine, and programmed it all myself in C#. It was a bizarre idea that took around two years of my life to actualize, but in my opinion, it was worth the effort.

                                        Since being published as a free game on steam in May of 2019, BirdGut has accumulated over 120,000 downloaders, and has recieved over 1,600 reviews, 95% of which are positive. You can visit the steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1072390/BirdGut/">here</a> to read the reviews for yourself. The feedback I have recieved from players made all the effort worthwhile. I have learned so much since I finished the game, and I can't wait to put the new information to use in my next project.

                                        Though I made the game almost entirely by myself, I am always excited to have the chance to work on a team. It was sometimes stressful to build the game alone.

                                        BirdGut was not a particularly small game. On the first playthrough, it takes around 2 and a half hours to complete, and that's ignoring the secrets sprinkled throughout that the player can go back through and discover. I designed all the levels, wrote the dialogue, programmed drew, and animated everything, and even recorded and edited all of the sounds in the game. That's why those two hours of gameplay took two years to make.
                                    </p>
                                    <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                        I learned so much in the process of making the game, that by the time I finshed building the last level of the game, I had to redo levels in the beginning whose designs I made when I was less experienced. Starting production at age 14, I changed quite a bit as a person over the course of the game, and I had to change my ideas often. For example, the game was originally supposed to follow the protagonist through each system inside the bird, from digestive, to respiratory, to cardiovascular, and so on, with the final boss being the brain. Realizing that I had limited time, I chose only to make the digestive system.

                                        The biggest lesson that I learned from making BirdGut was about perseverance. I ran into problems that almost convinced me to quit, but I never did. There was a problem with the physics in the code of the game once that took a little over a month to solve. Even when it seemed like there was no way to solve a problem, I stuck with it, and I always found a solution. I learned that, no matter what, there is a solution to the problem, and if I can't find it, I'm just looking in the wrong place. When tackling a problem that seems impossible, I look at it from every possible angle and then some.
