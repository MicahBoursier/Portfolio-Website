                                I always wanted to experiment with multiplayer in my video games so I tried my hand at it. I made a functioning 3d multiplayer 
                                survival game to play with my friends. While its content was limited, and it was very small, it was fairly complex, in terms of 
                                other games I had made prior.
                            </p>

                                I used this game as an opportunity to experiment with concepts I hadn't tried before. It had a simple crafting system, an inventory 
                                system with equippable and edible items, a farming system, buildings systems, item sharing, and enemies with simple pathfinding ai. 
                                The amount of content was fairly minimal, but it was simply a concept for a survival game system that I hadn't tried before. With 
                                multiplayer on, it was fun to play around with friends in. The multiplayer networking was by far the hardest thing to write the code for. 
                                There was a lot of tangled relationships between clients, that were hard for me to visualize, but I pulled it off enough for it to work.

                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".6s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                I abandoned this project to work on other, more unique video games, because I feel that there are enough survival games in existence 
                                already. The experience was not useless, however, because many of the skills I learned and concepts I developed can be used in future 
                                games. As an experiment, I it was very useful.
