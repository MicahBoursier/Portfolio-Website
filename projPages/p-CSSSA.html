                                In the summer of 2019, I was accepted into the California State Summer School for the Arts (also known as CSSSA) for animation. 
                                CSSSA is an intensive, four-week-long program in which you stay on the CalArts campus, and take daily classes on animation (or 
                                whatever other discipline you entered for). During the last 2-3 weeks of your stay, you are tasked with producing an animated 
                                short film. I chose to make <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CY4iXY_CqWidZOBtSfCUL2QLLIUAafTk/view?usp=sharing" target='new'>this</a> 
                                short film, titled "Pheromones."
                            </p>
							<p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                The film had to combine at least two different mediums, so I made the background in watercolor, and animated over it digitally. 
                                I wanted to convey the similarity between humans and the creaures we share this planet with, to show that we aren't as superior 
                                or advanced as we think we are. I wanted to show that our daily struggles are no more significant in the grand scheme of things 
                                than the endles toil of ants in the dirt. I always admired animated films that could convey a concept so clearly and so simply, 
                                without dialogue.
                            </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                Three of the students in the CSSSA animation program are granted a scholarship every year, and this short film earned me one of 
                                those scholarships. I earned a Herb Alpert foundation scholarship for young artists.
