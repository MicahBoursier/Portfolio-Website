                                One day, I realized how easy it would be to simulate the concept of evolution in unity, so I made a program in about 3 hours to see if I really could. In evolution, creatures that live long enough to mate get to carry on their genes in the next generation. It's simple natural selection. In my version, the creature that passes the finish line in a 2d race gets to have its attributes carried over into the next generation, like they would genetically. in the end, after repeating the test for enough generations, the creatures would all be much faster, and generally unified in form

                                The creatures are simple. They consist of one rectangle that act as a weight (the "body"), and one long rectangle that spins, pulling it forward (the "arm"). The dimensions of these two shapes, as well as the speed and direction of the rotation and even the color are considered genetic variables. If a creature with a short body, and a very long, fast spinning arm passes the finish line first, then the next generation of creatures will be varied, but biased towards similar dimensions as their victorious predecessor. the variation in the creature's design over time slowly becomes more consistent until the ultimate creature is created, and nothing can move faster. while it may be an oversimplification of evolution, I find it nicely demonstrates a concept wich may be used to generate ultimate designs for things in the future.
